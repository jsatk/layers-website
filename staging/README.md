# bringyourlayers.com

This is the repo for the Layers website.  The website was designed by [Grayson Yokota](http://yokotagrayson.com/) on his Windows PC (much to Jessie and Elaine's dismay).

## Technologies Used
This site was built on top of the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com).  It is extremely light on third-party code.  The only third party javascript used is jQuery, Modernizr. Google Maps, Google Analytics, and Tito embeds both use their own JS as well.  The CSS uses a normalize.css as a base.  The font is [TT Prosto Sans Condensed](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-type/tt-prosto-sans-condensed/).  All images that are not photos are rendered in SVG.

## Tools
All the code was written in Vim and fueled by bourbon.  All FTP shenanigans were handled using Coda.  All snacks were provided by Jessie and Elaine.
