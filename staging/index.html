              <center><strong>&#10024;CODE OF CONDUCT&#10024;</strong></center>

              <p>
                Hi, this is Jessie Char and Elaine Pow and we're the organizers of this conference. You may be asking, "Jessie and Elaine, what are you doing in the code of conduct?" and that's a great question. We're here to explain our behavior policies at Layers.
              </p>

              <p>&#127908;&#128120;&#128120;Ahem:</p>

              <p>
                Layers is committed to providing a harassment-free event for everyone. Harassment doesn't only take place as a result of intention; it can also happen when we don't stop to think about how our choices may make others uncomfortable. Let's go over some common forms of harassment:
              </p>

              <p>
                &#128683;&nbsp;Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, etc.<br>
                &#128683;&nbsp;Bullying of any kind<br>
                &#128683;&nbsp;Sexual images in public spaces<br>
                &#128683;&nbsp;Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following<br>
                &#128683;&nbsp;Sustained disruption of talks or other events<br>
                &#128683;&nbsp;Uninvited and/or inappropriate physical contact<br>
                &#128683;&nbsp;Unwelcome sexual attention<br>
                &#128683;&nbsp;Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour<br>
              </p>

              <p>
                If any Layers attendee engages in one or more of the inappropriate behaviors listed above, we reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary. This includes, but is not limited to: issuing a warning, complete removal from the conference without refund, and contacting the appropriate authorities.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the unfortunate case that anyone is made to feel uncomfortable at our event, notify us or one of our volunteers directly (we'll be highly visible at the conference). Whether it's a full-fledged complaint, or a "hey, that person could have handled this better" comment, we are dedicated to providing a safe space for everyone to discuss their experience. If you are uncomfortable approaching us in person, email us at <a href="mailto:info@bringyourlayers.com">info@bringyourlayers.com</a> or <a href="https://openingnight.wufoo.com/forms/zsu3b0y04srsmu/" target="_blank">submit an anonymous form</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                You may be thinking "This isn't as much code of conduct writing as I'm used to seeing. How are these two princess emoji really going to handle a broken conduct situation?" As working women who've experienced all sorts of behaviors directed toward us in professional situations and environments, harassment will not be taken lightly.
              </p>

              <p>

                <em>Thanks to <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy" target="_blank">Geek Feminism</a> for the list of what qualifies as harassment.
